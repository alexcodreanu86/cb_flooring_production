####This webapp is still under construction.

###Description: 
I am building it for my brother. The ultimate goal is to have a website that displays a bunch of his galleryes, has some information about him and gives the visitor the ability to requet a quote. When a quote request is submited an email is sent to my brother with the name and phone number of the person that submits the request, I will probably provide a timeframe when the customer wants to be called. 

On the admin side, my brother's side, he will have the ability to create new albums, also view a list of unchecked requests, mark them as checked. If I will have time I may incorporate google calendars so he could schedule appointments directly on his calendar with the name, phone number and any other fields in this table. This readme will update as the projects evolves.

In case I haven't crashed the server it can be visited [here](http://cbflooringinc.com).
